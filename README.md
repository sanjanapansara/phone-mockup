 Chat Interface UI with Ant Design and React This project is a simple chat interface built using React and Ant Design. It simulates a messaging app UI, including a scrollable message list, a sticky header, and a footer for sending messages.

Message List: Messages are dynamically rendered using Ant Design's List component with avatars, timestamps, and file attachments. Sticky Header and Footer: The header remains fixed at the top, and the footer stays anchored at the bottom of the screen regardless of the number of messages. File Attachments: Message items can display file attachments with icons. Input Area: A TextArea for composing messages with a send button (SendOutlined). Tech Stack: React: Functional components with hooks. Ant Design: Components for layout, lists, and input. CSS: Custom styles for layout and positioning.
